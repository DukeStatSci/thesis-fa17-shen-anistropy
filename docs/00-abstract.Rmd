Isotropic covariance functions are routinely adopted in specifying models for point-referenced spatial data. Implicit in such modeling is the assumption that spatial dependence is not directional. Geometric anisotropic models offer a class of specifications which incorporate directional dependence. They have received sparse attention in the literature because their associated number of parameters increase and become difficult to identify as we increase richness of the function. Adopting a Bayesian framework, this paper attempts to illuminate when and how much such models for random effects in geostatistical settings improve predictive performance.  We show that geometric anisotropy yields better predictive performance when the data significantly departs from isotropy (anisotropy ratio is much greater than one), and that the improvement is more prominent when spatial variance is greater than pure error. The improvement in predictive performance is illustrated through simulation investigation as well as modeling data on scallop catches. We implement full Bayesian inference for model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, adding kriging using composition sampling.
